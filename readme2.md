## User Login 
We wil use the meteor useraccounts system 


Users will be able to authenticate with instagram
https://github.com/yubozhao/meteor-accounts-instagram

## Getting Data from Instagram 

we will pull data into a collection called "ig-social-posts"


### API endpoint

IF a user authenticates with Instagram we will create an API monitoring process 

the data from the instagram api we want to get is 
https://www.instagram.com/developer/endpoints/users/#get_users_media_recent_self

you need to get an access_token from Instagram 

go to https://api.instagram.com/oauth/authorize/?client_id=92d306a2ca44464098e8ae3c0a128ee6&redirect_uri=http://localhost&response_type=token

and then enter it in this url 
https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/self/media/recent/?access_token=

you will get a response like this 

https://github.com/firemountain/basic-meteor-app/blob/master/example.json

### processing 

We want to check this API endpoint every 1 min for new data 

When there is new data we want to create or update the objects in "ig-social-posts"

## exmaple #1 of an object in our "ig-social-posts" collection

## fields we want to out put into the html template from example #1 
```

- caption.created_time: "1496553260",
- created_time: "1496553260"
- tags: ["selfie"],
- link: "https://www.instagram.com/p/BU59Dayhq34/",
- caption.text: "Face made when staring at the phone screen, same face I'm making now ‚ú®üçÑ‚ú®",
```

## fields we want to out put into the html template example #2 
```
-images.standard_resolution.url: "https://scontent.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/18950380_112616532676321_3768085580282331136_n.jpg"
-caption.created_time: "1497311140",
-tags: ["crazybeautiful"]
-link: "https://www.instagram.com/p/BVQimIhhYyy/",
-caption.text: ". # Wood Flow . ## What did I find? . A #crazybeautiful piece of wood **spiraling** in the _woods_ . ## and 1. One 2. Two",
```      


***## BUT we need to do some stuff with the caption.text***
we need to make a custom text parser to find different styles of formatting 

### note about line spaces...

we will use " . " to find line spaces 
so anywhere we find a " . " it is treated as a line space, *note* the leading and trailing spaces are important 

## finding and saving other elements

### saving elements
- for each type we find we save it to a new array property within "caption"
- so for e.g.
- caption.h1 : ["Wood Flow"]
- caption.h2 : ["What did I find?","and"]
- caption.emphasis : ["spiraling","woods"]
- caption.p ["# Wood Flow","## What did I find?","A #crazybeautiful piece of wood **spiraling** in the _woods_","## and 1. One 2. Two . $0.00"]



### finding elements
part of the parser will look for elements from github markdown style formatting
here is github style markdown cheatsheet https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet

of this style we will support 
- all the types of headers here, https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#headers
- all the types of emphasis here, https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#emphasis
- ordered lists, e.g. the first 1. 2. here https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#lists

additionaly:
text that has one or two or more "-" before and after will be saved to caption.h1[]
    - e.g. "--this is an h1--"

text that has three or more "-" before and after will be saved to caption.h2[]
    - e.g. "---this is an h2---"

caption.text between " . " will be saved as caption.p[], this is also true for the text at the end after the last " . " text at the beginning before the first " . "


### we need to get links 
- for links we will need to do further parsing, usign regex, and looking for "http://" and "www." to find the links 
    - links found will be saved sequentially in an array to a new property called caption.links :[]  

### We need to create a new property called "caption.title",
- the text value of this new property is either, the 1st "h1[]" OR "h2[]" found via the markdown parsing, 
- OR the first few words of the caption.text
    - the "first few words"  are found by at the the first 27 characters of the caption.text and getting only whole words that fit within that limit.
        - so for e.g. in the caption text for exmaple-1 above, the first 27 characters are "Face made when staring at t", we would remove the "t" and replace it with "...", and save "Face made when staring at ..." to a new property called "caption.title"


### here is an example of how the template might look 

```
<div class="col l4 m6 s12 gallery-item gallery-expand gallery-filter {{collection}}-{{tag[]}}"> // the {{tag[]}} is all the values in tags[] that match the collection.tagArray. so, for e.g. this could be class="ig-social-posts-crazybeautiful", with "ig-social-posts" being the name of the colleciton, and "crazybeautiful" being a tag on the object 
        <div class="gallery-curve-wrapper">
            <a class="gallery-cover gray">
                <img src="{{collection.images.standard_resolution.url}}" alt="{{caption.title}}"> // note that the {{caption.title}} is used for the alt=""
            </a>
            <div class="gallery-header">
                <span>{{collection.caption.title}}</span> // caption.title 
            </div>
            
            <div class="gallery-body">
                <div class="title-wrapper">

                  <span class="price">{{colleciton.caption.created_time}}</span>  // this needs to be in date format 
                </div>
                
                /// below is a bit tricker becasue we need to break up the collection.caption.p[] into different divs and place the h1's, h2's, links, etc, correctly 

                <p><h1>{{collection.caption.h1[0]}}</h1></p>
                <p><h2>{{collection.caption.h2[0]}}</h2></p>
                <p>{{collection.caption.p[2]}}</p>
                <p><h2>{{collection.caption.h2[1]}}</h2><p>{{collection.caption.p[3]}}</p></p>
            </div>
